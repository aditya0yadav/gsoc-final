# Google Summer of Code 2025 - Final Submission
## Flexible Serializer Layer for Apache Dubbo Python

**Student:** Aditya  
**Organization:** Apache Software Foundation  
**Project:** Apache Dubbo Python  
**Mentor:** [Zaki](https://github.com/cnzakii)

## Project Overview

This project focused on building a comprehensive and flexible serializer layer for Apache Dubbo Python, enabling support for multiple serialization formats including JSON and Protobuf. The implementation provides dynamic serialization parameter acceptance and seamless routing between different serialization strategies.

### Project Goals
- Design and implement a flexible, extensible serializer architecture
- Support multiple serialization formats (JSON and Protobuf)
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing Dubbo workflows
- Provide comprehensive configuration options for both client and server sides
- Implement robust fallback strategies and error handling

## Key Achievements

### Completed Features

#### 1. Flexible Serializer Architecture
- Built a three-layer serialization strategy with intelligent fallbacks
- Implemented MethodDescriptor for standardized method metadata handling
- Created comprehensive parameter and return type inference system

#### 2. JSON Serializer Implementation (Completed)
- Multi-layer strategy: Pydantic → orjson → standard json
- Advanced type support: datetime, frozenset, UUID, tuple, set
- Robust nested JSON handlers for complex data structures
- Full RPC integration with both single and multi-parameter methods

#### 3. Protobuf Serializer Implementation (Under Review)
- Complete Protobuf serialization support
- Seamless integration with existing .proto definitions
- Optimized for single-parameter RPC methods (Protobuf standard)

#### 4. Client & Server Configuration System
- Automatic inference from interface definitions
- Manual configuration support for custom serialization logic
- Flexible parameter override system
- Comprehensive codec management

### Implementation Statistics
- 2 Major Serializers: JSON (Completed), Protobuf (Under Review)
- 2 Pull Requests: JSON ready for merge, Protobuf under review
- Comprehensive test coverage for all serializer implementations
- Production-ready design for enterprise-grade applications

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture

```python
@dataclass
class ParamDetail:
    """Represents metadata about a function parameter."""
    name: str
    annotation: Any
    is_required: bool = True
    default: Any = None

@dataclass
class MethodDescriptor:
    """Describes the metadata of a callable method."""
    func: Callable
    name: str
    params: list[ParamDetail]
    return_param: ParamDetail
    doc: Optional[str] = None
```

### Serialization Strategy

The implementation follows a **three-layer fallback strategy**:

1. **Primary**: Pydantic-based serialization with validation
2. **Secondary**: High-performance orjson for JSON handling
3. **Fallback**: Standard Python json module

### Configuration Examples

#### Using Interface Auto-Inference
```python
class GreeterServiceStub(GreeterService):
    def __init__(self, client: dubbo.Client):
        self.client = client
        # Automatically infer from interface
        self._say_hello = client.unary(interface=self.sayHello)
        # Override with custom configuration
        self._say_many = client.unary(
            method_name="listUsers",
            params_types=[UserRequest],
            return_type=UserListResponse,
            codec="json",
        )
```

#### Manual Configuration
```python
class GreeterServiceStub:
    def __init__(self, client: dubbo.Client):
        self.client = client
        # Full manual configuration
        self._say_hello = client.unary(
            method_name="sayHello",
            params_types=[greeter_pb2.GreeterRequest],
            return_type=greeter_pb2.GreeterReply,
            codec="protobuf"
        )
```
